This is an emacs major mode that provides some features for editing
gitolite configuration files.

The current features include:
 - move to next repository definition: C-c C-n
 - move to previous repository definition: C-c C-p
 - go to the include file on the line where the cursor is: C-c C-v
 - open a navigation window with all the repositories (hyperlink enabled): C-c C-l
 - mark the current repository and body: C-c C-m

It supports basic syntax based font colours, so it will highlight interesting parts of the configuration file:
   - comments
   - repo definitions
   - rules
   - refexes
   - groups
   ...
